      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Ok so fist off hi!.......that was a lot.</p>
      <p>Let's try that again. </p>
      <p>Hi. My name is Skye Clarke, I'm 16, a libra, and have a dark sense of humor that just doesn't click with some people. *sigh*. Anyway, I also enjoy drawing when it doesn't end up looking like utter trash (which is rare btw), and use to be a really huge church girl when I was younger, though now I just refuse to go Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.  </p>
      <p>Wow that was a bunch of useless information. What would be more interesting?</p>
      <p>I got it! </p>

      <h2>Near death experiences<img src="reaper.gif" alt="codes" width="200" height="200" align="right"></h2>
      <p>So to start off, throughout my life I have had many close encounters with death, in which could be said to have impact the way I see life and why it fascinates me enough to influence me into wanting to become a baby deliverer in the future. </p>
      <p>For me, life is a beautiful thing that can be lengthy as Mount Everest or shorter than a dot can be cut off in a moment. "You have to live life to the fullest" and blah blah.</p>
      <p>Anyway back to my near death experiences list ðŸ¤£</p>
      <ol>
        <li> An hour after my birth I was diagnosed with pneumonia(barely recovered but here I am hahaha...)</li>
        <li> Three years later I nearly contracted a life threatening concussion. That happened as a result of me deciding to act like one of my bed time story characters from Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed and as the title describes, I decided to jump on my bed. You can guess what happened after thatðŸ˜¬.</li>
        <li>Then two years later I once again high fived with death as I almost drowned at the bottom of the sea never to be seen again. But haha once again here I amðŸ™‚. </li>
        </ol>
      <p>We'll stop here for now as anymore would be...odd</p>
      <p>Next topic!!!</p>

          <h2>My passion for coding</h2>
          <p>So you're probably wondering how did i get here? How did I find a passion for coding? (Even if you don't care, because same, let's pretend you do)<img src="coding.gif" alt="codes" width="250" height="250" align="right"></p>
          <p>Well frankly I was forced into it at first</p>
          <p>To elaborate, at my school in order to continue taking honors trig, you also have to take C++. At first I was dreading having to take such a class because....it was an extra class. However, once I started taking it I found it to be actually quite fun and mind engaging.
            <P>Yeah that was it. That was how I found out I enjoyed coding.</P>
